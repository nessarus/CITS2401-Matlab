%% Conjugate Transpose of Complex Matrix  

%% 
% Create a 2-by-2 matrix with complex elements. 
A = [0-1i 2+1i;4+2i 0-2i]  

%% 
% Find the conjugate transpose of |A|. 
B = A' 

%%
% The result, |B|, contains the elements of |A| with the row and column
% indices interchanged. The sign of the imaginary part of each number is
% also switched.
